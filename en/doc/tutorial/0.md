Clicking on either MyCrypto, MEW or MetaMask will auto-populate the “To address”, “Amount to send”, “Gas Limit” and “Data”fields. If using a different platform, kindly copy the details provided from the bottom and paste it into the provider of your choice.
In our example, we will illustrate using MEW, but you can use whichever platform you are comfortable with.
In this case, click on MEW.
