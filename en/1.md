```
The participants will have an opportunity to earn up to 25 million OLT tokens during this program, 
depending on how many tokens they decide to lock-up and at what bonus. 
The program will automatically close and will no longer receive any more deposits once the max bonus of 25 million OLT tokens has been reached to give out to participants or on December 31,
2018 (11:59pm EST), whichever event occurs first.

```
To take advantage of this program, kindly follow the steps as illustrated below:
